### Redis Demonstration
**The project demonstrates how Redis can significantly enhance the performance of our application. Without Redis, the endpoint `http://localhost:8080/api/` takes approximately **400ms** for CRUD operations. However, with Redis as a caching layer, the response time improves dramatically to just **28ms**, showcasing the efficiency gained through caching.
